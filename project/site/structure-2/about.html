		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Founded in 2016 by James Maxwell, Hell Burger has come a long way from its beginnings as a local food truck. When James first started out, his passion for “All American” cuisine drove them to do tons of research so that Hell Burger can offer you game-changing, savory food. 5 years later, we now serve customers at our restaurant in Crystal City, Virginia, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our  passion into a full-time business.</p>
		
		<p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we do. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
