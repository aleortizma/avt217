<a href="https://mellowmushroom.com/"> <h2>Mellow Mushroom</h2><br><br></a>
	<a href="https://mellowmushroom.com/"><img src="mellow.png" alt="Mellow Mushroom Image" class="center"></a>

	<p>Of all the websites I've viewed, Mellow Mushroom’s is my favorite. It’s fun, spunky, and hip––all while maintaining the seriousness of an established brand. The site has a great use of animation that grabs attention. The site's colors stay true to their orange and grey scheme and uses a variety of textures and patterns throughout. The site is well organized, functional, and does a great job of giving customers an idea of their brand personality. </p>

	<a href="https://michiramen.com/"><img src="ramen.png" alt="Michi Ramen Image" class="center"></a>

	<p>Michi Ramen's website grabs your attention with the use of their hero image. The font choice and bright color scheme create a modern and friendly look and feel. The content in the website is simple and straightforward which serves well for functionality. </p>

	<p>The layout for Akira Sushi's site is inviting and functional. All the information you need can be accessed by scrolling down the main page or clicking on the menu tab which will take you to the designated section. Great use of imagery. All the information is straight to the point.</p>

<a href="https://mezeh.com/"> <h2>Mezeh</h2><br><br></a>
	<a href="https://mezeh.com/"><img src="mezeh.png" alt="Mezeh Image" class="center"></a>

	<p>Mezeh has dynamic animations throughout their site that keeps customers focused while they browse. They also do a good job with enticing costumers to order online by showing delicious and colorful looking images of their bowls, ingredients, and drinks. </p>

<a href="https://goodstuffeatery.com/"> <h2>Good Stuff Eatery</h2><br><br></a>
	<a href="https://goodstuffeatery.com/"><img src="goodeatery.png" alt="Good eatery Image" class="center"></a>

	<p>Good Stuff Eatery does an amazing job grabbing the customer's attention by utilizing bright, fresh images––emphasizing their all-natural, farm-to-table products. Although this site is on the simplier side, it's functional and gives the audience a good understanding of their brand and mission. </p>
