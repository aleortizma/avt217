<h1>Design Brief and Site Content</h1>

<h2>Project Statement</h2>
<p>Create a website for a family-owned restaurant, Hell Burger. It is a family-owned business serving quality classic American food. It also sells t-shirts, tote bags, and other accessories.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Provide a space to showcase Hell Burger’s menu, background/history, merchandise, and contact info.</p>

<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Based on my research, websites for restaurants truly invest in high quality imagery to entice customers to try their food. They succeed at being memorable by exuding a unique brand personality, providing amazing customer service, and having a “user-friendly” website. Easy navigation and quick information are key. Additionally, because of the pandemic, more consumers are conscious about supporting local family-owned locations instead of chain restaurants.<br> 
<br>
My goal for this project is to create a dynamic website that has mouth-watering images, establish a fun/edgy personality for Hell Burger, and truly hone in on the fact that is it a “family-owned business.”
